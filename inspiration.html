						<td><h4> OPENINGS </h4><p>As an amateur photographer, I draw inspiration from the world around me.  In this album, I imagine all the different connotations of the word 'Openings'.  What it means to open, to expose, uncover, or become aware. </p></td>
						<td><h4> QUOTES </h4><p>Here is a collection of quotes that changed my life, or just made me see part of it in a different perspective.  The ones I've put on a picture background are my own.  And the others I've pulled from famous authors and thinkers.</p></td>
