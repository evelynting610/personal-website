					<h3> Fracking </h3>
					<p>a cross between<br>
					Frick     and <br>
					Cracking&#46;&#46;&#46;<br>
					open the ground<br>
					Contaminating water<br>
					Causing<br>
					Clash of neighbor against neighbor<br>
					Catastrophe of oil<br>
					spilling into<br>
					Our waters<br>
					Poisoning the well</p>


					<h3> Writing is not a Subject </h3>
					<p>&lsquo;Writing&rsquo; is not a subject.<br>
					Why not call it &lsquo;Thinking&rsquo; instead.<br>
					Or &ldquo;interdisciplinary teleportation of neuron-caused stimuli via word&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Because Physics teaches physics<br>
					And Calculus teaches calculus<br>
					But unless you are in fifth grade,<br>
					You aren't taught how to WRITE in writing seminars</p>

					<p>Writing is like the glasses you lost, that when bending down to pick up your books, fell down across your head<br>
					Like the incessent grind of coffee way early in the morning<br>
					The background noise of every other subject<br>
					And yet it holds no individual identity</p>

					<p>I learned politics from <span>The Thief of Attolia</span> <br>
						ethical warfare through <span>Ender's Game</span><br>
						and quantum mechanics in Young Adult Fiction<br>
						Laura Ingalls Wilder threw me bareback behind her as we raced against restraint and found shelter in the violin</p>

					<p>Writing is an always portal<br>
						Writing is a means immortal<br>
						But Writing is never. just a subject</p>
