					<h3> Butterflies </h3>
					<p>Butterflies live<br>
						for 30 days<br>
						40 days if they're lucky <br>
						And I wonder <br>
						How do they feel time? <br>
						Do they feel a year <br>
						In one of our days? <br>
						Birthdays, holidays, friendship and laughter <br>
						What is that worth to butterflies? <br>
						What is that worth in the absence of time </p>

					<h3>Phaethon</h3>
					<p> His dreams were clouded in sparks of glitter <br>
						That bounced light, light, light<br>
						'cross the prisms of his mind: <br></p>

						<p>Thunder in his mouth, stubborn in his eye<br>
						With tousled raven locks<br>
						Too young to drive </p>

						<p>Ego took the reins, and <br>
							Free Rein took the horses.<br>
							The Sun slipping, spinning, stumbling<br>
							Startling the Son of the Sun-God</p>

						<p>The World Heaved<br>
							Great pregnant sighs<br>
							And then.  Began burning<br>
							in the light of his demise </p>

					<h3> Chastity </h3>
					<p>Chastity drapes a rainbow robe across Her shoulders<br>
						leaving wings unfettered<br>
						and shoulders bared to the world <br>
						with Full eyes <br>
						for caressing <br>
						with Full lips <br>
						for giving  (to another light)<br>
						for receiving  (when another asks) <br>
						Morsels of sacrificed love <br>
						Chastity.  Redefined </p>

					<h3>The Waves of Monotony</h3>
					<p> We do not live in time<br>
						But, rather, in memories<br>
						We bounce from memory to memory<br>
						Unbounded except for<Br>
						Time </p>

					<h3>Why I Run</h3>
					<p> Not for the body<br>
						But for the soul<br>
						The release, the flight, leaping from reality<br>
						Escaping from the pain<br>
						As the pain feeds my soul<br>
						Every muscle screams in unison <br>
						in-in-out-out<br>
						in-in-out-out<br>
						Just keep breathing <Br>
						FIGHT<br>
						drowning everything in its own waterfall</p>


					<h3> Star Gazing </h3>
					<p> Green green grass gently grazing<br>
						my shoulders<br>
						my back<br>
						the sides of my calves<br>
						Everything sunk in a green grass-angel<br>
						as we chat <br>
						heads against bellies<br>
						ideas mingling with ideas<br>
						watching the stars. <br>
						Two tiny dots<br>
						watching two tiny dots<br>
						in the rich volume of nothingness.<br>
						Separated by so many dimensions of time and space.<br>
						And yet completely connected.</p>
