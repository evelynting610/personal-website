					<h3> Writing is not a Subject </h3>
					<p>&lsquo;Writing&rsquo; is not a subject.<br>
					Why not call it &lsquo;Thinking&rsquo; instead.<br>
					Or &ldquo;interdisciplinary teleportation of neuron-caused stimuli via word&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Because Physics teaches physics<br>
					And Calculus teaches calculus<br>
					But unless you are in fifth grade,<br>
					You aren't taught how to WRITE in writing seminars</p>

					<p>Writing is like the glasses you lost, that when bending down to pick up your books, fell down across your head<br>
					Like the incessent grind of coffee way early in the morning<br>
					The background noise of every other subject<br>
					And yet it holds no individual identity</p>

					<p>I learned politics from <span>The Thief of Attolia</span> <br>
						ethical warfare through <span>Ender's Game</span><br>
						and quantum mechanics in Young Adult Fiction<br>
						Laura Ingalls Wilder threw me bareback behind her as we raced against restraint and found shelter in the violin</p>

					<p>Writing is an always portal<br>
						Writing is a means immortal<br>
						But Writing is never. just a subject</p>



					<h3> Butterflies </h3>
					<p>Butterflies live<br>
						for 30 days<br>
						40 days if they're lucky <br>
						And I wonder <br>
						How do they feel time? <br>
						Do they feel a year <br>
						In one of our days? <br>
						Birthdays, holidays, friendship and laughter <br>
						What is that worth to butterflies? <br>
						What is that worth in the absence of time </p>

					<h3>Phaethon</h3>
					<p> His dreams were clouded in sparks of glitter <br>
						That bounced light, light, light<br>
						'cross the prisms of his mind: <br></p>

						<p>Thunder in his mouth, stubborn in his eye<br>
						With tousled raven locks<br>
						Too young to drive </p>

						<p>Ego took the reins, and <br>
							Free Rein took the horses.<br>
							The Sun slipping, spinning, stumbling<br>
							Startling the Son of the Sun-God</p>

						<p>The World Heaved<br>
							Great pregnant sighs<br>
							And then.  Began burning<br>
							in the light of his demise </p>

					<h3>The Waves of Monotony</h3>
					<p> We do not live in time<br>
						But, rather, in memories<br>
						We bounce from memory to memory<br>
						Unbounded except for<Br>
						Time </p>

					<h3>Why I Run</h3>
					<p> Not for the body<br>
						But for the soul<br>
						The release, the flight, leaping from reality<br>
						Escaping from the pain<br>
						As the pain feeds my soul<br>
						Every muscle screams in unison <br>
						in-in-out-out<br>
						in-in-out-out<br>
						Just keep breathing <Br>
						FIGHT<br>
						drowning everything in its own waterfall</p>


					<h3> Star Gazing </h3>
					<p> Green green grass gently grazing<br>
						my shoulders<br>
						my back<br>
						the sides of my calves<br>
						Everything sunk in a green grass-angel<br>
						as we chat <br>
						heads against bellies<br>
						ideas mingling with ideas<br>
						watching the stars. <br>
						Two tiny dots<br>
						watching two tiny dots<br>
						in the rich volume of nothingness.<br>
						Separated by so many dimensions of time and space.<br>
						And yet completely connected.</p>
