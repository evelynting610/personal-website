					<td><p> Welcome to my website!  My name is Evelyn Ting, and I am an aspiring computer programmer.  This is my personal website, dedicated to poetry, quotes, pictures, and reflection.</p>

						<p>I am a thinker, a dreamer, a skipper, and a fighter.  I believe in childish wonder, and the power of the imagination.  My favorite activity is curling up with a good book.  Preferably in a recliner, with lots of pillows, bread, and hot chocolate.  I like long dresses and big philosophical ideas.  Sometimes, I stay up until one AM; debating and challenging the way our world is perceived.  My other hobbies include playing violin, and taking long walks.</p></td>
